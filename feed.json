				"content_html": "<p>This has been the most exciting <a href=\"https://candidates2024.fide.com/\">Chess Candidates tournament</a>&mdash;or any chess tournament&mdash;I&rsquo;ve ever seen. Tomorrow is round 13 of 14 and we have a three-way tie for first, with Fabiano Caruana, who was considered by most to be the tournament favorite just a half-game back. And in the final two rounds, three games feature those top four, plus games with some of the potentially most dangerous folks from further down the leaderboard. It&rsquo;s wild.</p>\n<p>No small amount of the excitement is coming from the time control, with two hours flat for the first forty moves + thirty-minutes and thirty-second increment starting at move 41 (with no third time control). I have mixed feelings about this.

				"content_text": "This has been the most exciting [Chess Candidates tournament](https://candidates2024.fide.com/)---or any chess tournament---I've ever seen. Tomorrow is round 13 of 14 and we have a three-way tie for first, with Fabiano Caruana, who was considered by most to be the tournament favorite just a half-game back. And in the final two rounds, three games feature those top four, plus games with some of the potentially most dangerous folks from further down the leaderboard. It's wild.\n\nNo small amount of the excitement is coming from the time control, with two hours flat for the first forty moves + thirty-minutes and thirty-second increment starting at move 41 (with no third time control). I have mixed feelings about this. The chess lover in me doesn't like speeding the classical game up, but the spectator is loving the drama.\n\nIt's very possible we'll go into tie-breaks. If we do, with the tie-breaks being rapid games, it will surely be high drama, but I will have solidly divided feelings: I don't think classical chess should ever be decided by time-controls that do not quality as classical chess by the organizing body.

German naturalist, Fritz M√ºller describes this mimicry as a phenomenon where two or more species that may or may not be closely related, but share a common predator, mimic the other‚Äôs warning signals.  Often, the usually clear identity of mimic and model are blurred. For instance, to assault the marauding darkness of despair, the immigrant speaks of homeland where the lights of the city yield to a pastoral rhythm, where the mangrove‚Äôs prayer is visible as evening falls, or where hyaline noon comes wrapped in noiseless rain. Soon, this life is dominated by the other life they must all begin: the riotous flickering of fluorescents, night shifts paralyzing daylight hours, the constant menacing of sirens. To survive, they pack their old selves into battered suitcases, don characterless uniforms, fit their faces into blank stares ‚Äì the mask becoming the man, but slowly.</p>\n<p>‚Äî<a href=\"https://wyrdbyword.xyz/l/stacia-cyrene-yearwood\" target=\"_blank\">Stacia Cyrene Yearwood</a><br />\n‚Äîfound in <a href=\"https://wyrdbyword.xyz/l/beltway-poetry-quarterly\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Beltway Poetry Quarterly</em></a> (<a href=\"https://wyrdbyword.xyz/l/beltway-poetry-quarterly-2013-v14-n4\" target=\"_blank\">Vol. 14, No. 4.; Fall 2013</a>)</p><p class=\"wdpalink\"><a href=\"https://buttondown.email/dailyish-poem/archive/\">[full  poem archive]</a></p>\n",

Gukesh\n9. Nepo\n\nI love that I will be happy, for various reasons, with *any* winner this time around. I'm definitely expecting some exciting chess and tournament dynamics.\n",

Once again on August 3, 2015. The fake teeth sit in a box in the garage. When she died, I touched them, smelled them, thought I heard a whimper. I shoved the teeth into my mouth. But having two sets of teeth only made me hungrier. When my mother died, I saw myself in the mirror, her words in a ring around my mouth, like powder from a donut. Her last words were in English. She asked for a Sprite. I wonder whether her last thought was in Chinese. I wonder what her last thought was. I used to think that a dead person‚Äôs words die with them. Now I know that they scatter, looking for meaning to attach to like a scent. My mother used to collect orange blossoms in a small shallow bowl. I pass the tree each spring. I always knew that grief was something I could smell. But I didn‚Äôt know that it‚Äôs not actually a noun but a verb. That it moves.</p>\n<p>‚Äî<a href=\"https://wyrdbyword.xyz/l/victoria-chang\" target=\"_blank\">Victoria Chang</a><br />\n‚Äîfound in <a href=\"https://wyrdbyword.xyz/l/victoria-chang-obit\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Obit</em></a> (2020)</p><p class=\"wdpalink\"><a href=\"https://buttondown.email/dailyish-poem/archive/\">[full  poem archive]</a></p>\n",

Its phenomena showed an artistic perfection usually associated with man-wrought things. Consider the imitation of oozing poison by bubblelike macules on a wing (complete with pseudo-refraction) or by glossy yellow knobs on a chrysalis (‚ÄúDon‚Äôt eat me‚ÄîI have already been squashed, sampled and rejected‚Äù). Consider the tricks of an acrobatic caterpillar (of the Lobster Moth) which in infancy looks like bird‚Äôs dung, but after molting develops scrabbly hymenopteroid appendages and baroque characteristics, allowing the extraordinary fellow to play two parts at once (like the actor in Oriental shows who becomes a pair of intertwisted wrestlers): that of a writhing larva and that of a big ant seemingly harrowing it. When a certain moth resembles a certain wasp in shape and color, it also walks and moves its antennae in a waspish, unmothlike manner. When a butterfly has to look like a leaf, not only are all the details of a leaf beautifully rendered but markings mimicking grub-bored holes are generously thrown in. ‚ÄúNatural selection,‚Äù in the Darwinian sense, could not explain the miraculous coincidence of imitative aspect and imitative behavior, nor could one appeal to the theory of ‚Äúthe struggle for life‚Äù when a protective device was carried to a point of mimetic subtlety, exuberance, and luxury far in excess of a predator‚Äôs power of appreciation. I discovered in nature the nonutilitarian delights that I sought in art.

In an age of materialist science, economics, art, and politics, we ought not to be much shocked by the appearance of materialist religion. We know we don‚Äôt have to look far to find people who equate more abundant life with a bigger car, a bigger house, a bigger bank account, and a bigger church. They are wrong, of course. If Jesus meant only that we should have more possessions or even more ‚Äúlife expectancy,‚Äù then John 10:10 is no more remarkable than an advertisement for any commodity whatever. Abundance, in this verse, cannot refer to an abundance of material possessions, for life does not require a material abundance; it requires only a material sufficiency. That sufficiency granted, life itself, which is a membership in the living world, is already an abundance.</p>\n<p>‚Äî<a href=\"https://wyrdbyword.xyz/l/wendell-berry\" target=\"_blank\">Wendell Berry</a><br />\n‚Äîfrom ‚ÄúThe Burden of the Gospels‚Äù<br />\n‚Äîfound in <a href=\"https://wyrdbyword.xyz/l/wendell-berry-way-ignorance-essays\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Way of Ignorance: And Other Essays</em></a> (2005)</p><p class=\"wdcalink\"><a href=\"https://commonplace.wyrdbyword.xyz/archive/\">[full archive]</a></p>\n",

That he really truly left this world with not a single bad feeling for me. That we ended as the sweetest of friends. None of that changed anything. There are dark black buttons tattooed on my heart. I‚Äôll carry them for the rest of my days.</p>\n<p>But there is another place in my heart that knows that I finally kept my promise. I was the one who took care of Toby right up to the very end, who stayed with him so he wouldn‚Äôt be alone. Just like Finn would have wanted. And sometimes, when I don‚Äôt want to be sad anymore, I think that makes it almost even.</p>\n<p>One thing I do know is that my superpower is gone. My heart is broken and soft, and I am plain again. I have no friends in the city. Not a single one. I used to think maybe I wanted to become a falconer, and now I‚Äôm sure of it, because I need to figure out the secret.

A nunnery in Nova Scotia with a broken clavichord. Smitten soldiers looking for prostitutes they slept with years ago during some war. Orphans writing school reports on osmosis or the mating habits of the praying mantis. Minor poets searching for obscure rhymes. Prisoners eager to debate Nietzsche‚Äôs will to power or their theories of transcendentalism in American advertising. I quit my job, stayed home waiting beside the telephone. I consulted tattered repair manuals, outdated phonebooks, defunct encyclopedias, old gossip tabloids. The dead were, of course, the most difficult, always calling from pay phones in the middle of night, emptying their despair in foreign tongues. I‚Äôd try to keep them talking, but always they‚Äôd drop the receiver and vanish. I‚Äôd wait in vain for their return, fall asleep listening to the crackle of fog on the other end, wind whistling guy wires, the long hollow calls of tugboats over black water. Or once, the patter of rain on giant jungle leaves, monkeys squealing from the canopy, the sad songs of brightly colored birds that I could not name.</p>\n<p>‚Äî<a href=\"https://wyrdbyword.xyz/l/brian-barker\" target=\"_blank\">Brian Barker</a><br />\n‚Äîfound in <a href=\"https://wyrdbyword.xyz/l/plume-poetry\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Plume</em></a> (<a href=\"https://wyrdbyword.xyz/l/plume-poetry-2024-march-issue-151\" target=\"_blank\">March 2024; Issue 51</a>)</p><p class=\"wdpalink\"><a href=\"https://buttondown.email/dailyish-poem/archive/\">[full  poem archive]</a></p>\n",

He told me that he‚Äôd traveled along a river that connects Mexico and Central America. As far as I know, there is no such river. But he told me he‚Äôd traveled along this river and that now he could say he knew its twists and tributaries. A river of trees or a river of sand or a river of trees that in certain stretches became a river of sand. A constant flow of people without work, of the poor and starving, drugs and suffering. A river of clouds he‚Äôd sailed on for twelve months, where he‚Äôd found countless islands and outposts, although not all the islands were settled, and sometimes he thought he‚Äôd stay and live on one of them forever or that he‚Äôd die there.</p>\n<p>Of all the islands he‚Äôd visited, two stood out. The island of the past, he said, where the only time was past time and the inhabitants were bored and more or less happy, but where the weight of illusion was so great that the island sank a little deeper into the river every day. And the island of the future, where the only time was the future, and the inhabitants were planners and strivers, such strivers, said Ulises, that they were likely to end up devouring one another.</p>\n<p>‚Äî<a href=\"https://wyrdbyword.xyz/l/roberto-bolano\" target=\"_blank\">Roberto Bola√±o</a> (translated by <a href=\"https://wyrdbyword.xyz/l/natasha-wimmer\" target=\"_blank\">Natasha Wimmer</a>)<br />\n‚Äîfound in <a href=\"https://wyrdbyword.xyz/l/roberto-bolano-savage-detectives\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Savage Detectives</em></a> (1998 as <em>Los Detectives Salvajes</em>; this translation 2007)</p><p class=\"wdcalink\"><a href=\"https://commonplace.wyrdbyword.xyz/archive/\">[full archive]</a></p>\n",

Carole looks up as the waitress steps towards them with a tray and places the drinks on the table then smiles and steps quickly away. You look as though you haven‚Äôt slept in a week, Eilish says, are you sleeping at all? Sleep, Carole says, her voice distant, far off in time, she looks across the table at Eilish without seeing her. I don‚Äôt sleep much at all, she says, I dream each night of a soundless sleep but that is impossible now, it took me some time before I understood that I was already asleep in a manner, you know, that I was sleeping all the time I thought I was awake, trying to see into the problem that stood before me like a great darkness, this silence consuming every moment of my life, I thought I‚Äôd go mad looking into it but then I awoke and began to see what they were doing to us, the brilliance of the act, they take something from you and replace it with silence and you‚Äôre confronted by that silence every waking moment and cannot live, you cease to be yourself and become a thing before this silence, a thing waiting for the silence to end, a thing on your knees begging and whispering to it all night and day, a thing waiting for what was taken to be returned and only then can you resume your life, but the silence doesn‚Äôt end, you see, they leave open the possibility that what you want will be returned some day and so you remain reduced, paralysed, dull as an old knife, and the silence does not end because the silence is the source of their power, that is its secret meaning. Eilish folds her arms and leans back in the chair, watching Carole reach into her bag, she brings a folder to the table. It is clear now they‚Äôve been lying to us all along, Carole says, that the silence is permanent, that our husbands will not be coming back, they will not be returned because they cannot be returned, everybody knows this, even the dogs on the street know it‚Ä¶</p>\n<p>‚Äî<a href=\"https://wyrdbyword.xyz/l/paul-lynch\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Lynch</a><br />\n‚Äîfound in <a href=\"https://wyrdbyword.xyz/l/paul-lynch-prophet-song\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Prophet Song</em></a> (2023)</p><p class=\"wdcalink\"><a href=\"https://commonplace.wyrdbyword.xyz/archive/\">[full archive]</a></p>\n",

It‚Äôs difficult to find an empty compartment, there simply are none. My bags are becoming heavy. Halfway down the platform I board, walk along the corridor and finally slide open a door. No one even looks up. I lift my luggage onto the rack and settle into a seat. Silence. It‚Äôs as if we‚Äôre waiting to see the doctor. I glance around. There are photographs of tourism on the wall, scenes of Brittany, Provence. Across from me is a girl with birthmarks on her leg, birthmarks the color of grape. My eye keeps falling to them. They‚Äôre shaped like channel islands.</p>\n<p>At last, with a little grunt, we begin to move. There‚Äôs a groaning of metal, the sharp slam of doors. A pleasant jolting over switches. The sky is pale. A Frenchman is sleeping in the corner seat, blue coat, blue pants. The blues do not match. They‚Äôre parts of two different suits. His socks are pearl grey.</p>\n<p>Soon we are rushing along an alley of departure, the houses of the suburbs flashing by, ordinary streets, apartments, gardens, walls. The secret life of France, into which one cannot penetrate, the life of photograph albums, uncles, names of dogs that have died. And in ten minutes, Paris is gone. The horizon, dense with buildings, vanishes. Already I feel free.</p>\n<p>Green, bourgeoise France. We are going at tremendous speed. We cross bridges, the sound short and drumming. The country is opening up. We are on our way to towns where no one goes. There are long, wheat-colored stretches and then green, level land, recumbent and rich. The farms are built of stone. The wisdom of generations knows that land is the only real wealth, a knowledge that need not question itself, need not change. Open country flat as playing fields. Stands of trees.</p>\n<p>She has moles on her face, too, and one of her fingers is bandaged. I try to imagine where she works‚Äìa <em>p√¢tisserie</em>, I decide. Yes, I can see her standing behind the glass cases of pastry. Yes. That‚Äôs just it. Her shoes are black, a little dusty. And very pointed. The points are absurd. Cheap rings on both hands. She wears a black pullover, a black skirt. She‚Äôs a bit heavy. Her brow is furrowed as she reads the love stories in <em>Echo Mode</em>. We seem to be going faster.</p>\n<p>‚Äî<a href=\"https://wyrdbyword.xyz/l/james-salter\" target=\"_blank\">James Salter</a><br />\n‚Äîfound in <a href=\"https://wyrdbyword.xyz/l/james-salter-sport-pastime\" target=\"_blank\"><em>A Sport and a Pastime</em></a> (1967)</p><p class=\"wdcalink\"><a href=\"https://commonplace.wyrdbyword.xyz/archive/\">[full archive]</a></p>\n",

When I have thought about the ways in which they differ from people in my own culture, I have realized that they are more afraid than we are. On a day-to-day basis, they have more fear. Not of being dumped into cold water from an umiak, not a debilitating fear. They are afraid because they accept fully what is violent and tragic in nature. It is a fear tied to their knowledge that sudden, cataclysmic events are as much a part of life, of really living, as are the moments when one pauses to look at something beautiful.

No need for corny art singing tribute to the worker or even for the <em>Manifesto</em>. Never before had I seen so many wealthy people gathered all in one place. If a tornado came through and wiped the whole thing out, the stock market would plummet and the net worth of a country the size of Slovenia would vanish from the ledgers in a day. I used to live in Baltimore and remembered the kind of people who would go to the Preakness in their stupid hats and Sunday best while the whole swath of the city it was situated in starved and languished for lack of funds. This was like that, but without the hats. I saw $30,000 Birkin bags and $10,000 Off-White Nikes. I saw people with the kind of Rolexes that make strangers cry on <em>Antiques Roadshow</em>. I saw Ozempic-riddled influencers and fleshy, T-shirt-clad tech bros and people who still talked with <em>Great Gatsby</em> accents as they sweated profusely in Yves Saint Laurent under the unforgiving Texas sun. The kind of money I saw will haunt me forever. People clinked glasses of free champagne in outfits worth more than the market price of all the organs in my body.

Then God said,</p>\n<p><em>Let there be light</em>, and then the big bang said,<br />\n<em>I am the light</em>. I dunno, I wasn‚Äôt there, but it‚Äôs something<br />\nto wrestle with, isn‚Äôt it, that we‚Äôre children of zero,<br />\nof zilch.

The democracy of life</p>\n<p>is that plants and people thrive<br />\nwherever rain and sun grant root, until death<br />\ndismantles our rise and shine into usefully<br />\nequal bits. Existence is a slob, full of mess<br />\nand clutter, wonder and wander, and the one thing<br />\nI‚Äôm purely against is a purist of any stripe<br />\nor feather.

For sure, it sounds deathly, as though the form is lost to the world, consigned to libraries and anthologies. (As if those are ever really dead.) There have been times ‚Äì ours is not one of them, I think I will want to say ‚Äì when the essay has seemed antique and moribund, fit only for the classroom and to become an object of nostalgia for the improving or diverting literature of the past. Essays, ancient or modern, can seem precious in their self-presentation, like things too well made ever to be handled. Touch them however and they are likely to come alive with the sedimented evidence of years; a constellation of glittering motes surrounds the supposedly solid thing, and the essay reveals itself to have been less compact and smooth than thought, but instead unbounded and mobile, a form with ambitions to be unformed. Which is to say ‚Äì I can‚Äôt prove it yet ‚Äì that the venerable genre of the essay has something to do with the future, with a sense of constant dispersal and coalescence. And for what it‚Äôs worth my attachment to them seems of the same conflicted order: I want essays to have some integrity (formally, not morally, speaking), their strands of thought and style and feeling so tightly woven they present a smooth and gleaming surface. And I want all this to unravel in the same moment, in the same work; I want the raggedness, the patchwork, a labyrinth‚Äôs-worth of stray threads.

K. Chesterton</a></p> \n<blockquote><p>Some little time ago Dr. David Forsyth delivered to the Section of Psychiatry (Royal Society of Medicine) an address which was certainly a psychological curiosity; of considerable interest to psychologists, pathologists, alienists and all other students of the mental breakdown in the modern world. It was a perfect and compact illustration of the very common combination of a superiority complex with arrested development, and inhibitions on almost all forms of intelligent curiosity. But I mention it here, not because of its narrowness, but of its direct negation of all that is really new in scientific discovery. It is no news to us that a materialist can be bigoted; but we do not always come upon so startling an example of his being antiquated.</p>\n<p>It is not worth while to take any particular notice of all the diseased stuff about sadism and masochism being the sources of religion. We may note in passing, with a rather dreary amusement, that this sort of writer can never sustain a connected train of thought; and that he gets even these dismal technical terms hopelessly entangled; for he declares that Islam stands for sadism and Christendom for masochism, having just argued that the Christian persecution of heretics was typically sadistic. But all this judgment of great human events, good or bad, in terms of some obscure streak of lunacy, is itself an amusement for lunatics.  It is exactly as if a man were to argue: ‚ÄúThere is a special sort of madman who thinks he is made of glass; I will call this disease Vitreosity; and I will then show that anybody anywhere, who for any reason had anything to do with glass was a victim of vitreosity. The desert merchants who were said to have invented glass, the medieval craftsmen who so successfully coloured glass, the early astronomers who first fitted telescopes with lenses of glass, all showed Vitreosity in various stages of that disease; it is akin to subconscious libido because Peeping Tom looked through a window, which may have been made of glass; it is the root impulse of alcoholism, because people drink out of glasses; and Prince Albert and Queen Victoria were obviously stricken with raving and uncontrolled Vitreosity; because they built the Crystal Palace.‚Äù  The slight defect in this theory (which is quite as scientific as Dr. Forsyth‚Äôs) is that in order to theorise, it is sometimes useful to think. It is obvious that all these people had a thousand other reasons for doing all they did, besides being mad on glass; and it is equally obvious that the great religions, true or false, had a thousand reasons for doing all they did, without being mad on masochism or sadism.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>‚Äî<a href=\"https://wyrdbyword.xyz/l/g-k-chesterton\" target=\"_blank\">G.

A rhino-horn of land that juts into the Sea of Marmara, 1,700 miles east of Paris and 1,400 miles north of Baghdad, Stamboul proper, which was founded at the very edge of Europe and within eyeshot of Asia, comes into her own in the classical age when boat technology developed to allow more people, trade goods, armed troops and novel ideas to travel. She flourished when men and women acted on a prehistoric word-idea that, I would argue, kick-starts civilisation. This Proto-Indo-European term <em>ghosti</em> (from which we get the words guest, host and ghost) referred to a kind of unspoken etiquette, a notion that on seeing strangers on the horizon, rather than choose to fell them with spears or sling-shots, instead we should take the risk of welcoming them across our threshold ‚Äì on the chance that they might bring new notions, new goods, fresh blood with them. Over time this word-idea evolved into the Greek <em>xenia</em> ‚Äì ritualised guest‚Äìhost friendship, an understanding that stitched together the ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern worlds. Thanks to new DNA skeletal evidence we now realise that ancient peoples travelled far greater distances and more systematically than we once thought. If civilisation is about reaching out beyond the horizon to embrace the unknown, about making connections, about working out how to live with ourselves and with others, then for both East and West alike Istanbul is perfectly placed to satisfy that urge. And today the need to understand the narrative of what one Byzantine called ‚Äòthe city of the world‚Äôs desire‚Äô is ever more urgent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>‚Äî<a href=\"https://wyrdbyword.xyz/l/bettany-hughes\" target=\"_blank\">Bettany Hughes</a><br />\n‚Äîfound in <a href=\"https://wyrdbyword.xyz/l/bettany-hughes-istanbul\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Istanbul: A Tale of Three Cities</em></a> (2017)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wdcalink\"><a href=\"https://commonplace.wyrdbyword.xyz/archive/\">[full archive]</a></p>\n",

Is Kitsey right? If your deepest self is singing and coaxing you straight toward the bonfire, is it better to turn away? Stop your ears with wax? Ignore all the perverse glory your heart is screaming at you? Set yourself on the course that will lead you dutifully towards the norm, reasonable hours and regular medical check-ups, stable relationships and steady career advancement, the New York Times and brunch on Sunday, all with the promise of being somehow a better person? Or‚Äîlike Boris‚Äîis it better to throw yourself head first and laughing into the holy rage calling your name?</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs not about outward appearances but inward significance.

Shame, Despair, Solitude! These had been her teachers,‚Äîstern and wild ones,‚Äîand they had made her strong, but taught her much amiss. (pp. 183‚Äì4)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the end, then, she must be corrected, and unlike Dora‚ÄîFreud‚Äôs patient who flees from what had become the iron framework of his treatment, leaving her analysis in mid-stream‚ÄîHester, in the dark conclusion of Hawthorne‚Äôs brooding novel, reassumes the Puritan mantle. She assures the women who come to her for counsel and comfort that there will be a new order of living between women and men, grounded not in sorrow but in mutual happiness. She knows that ‚Äúthe angel and apostle of the coming revelation must be a woman‚Äù and had once imagined this prophetess might be herself. But the angel must be ‚Äúlofty [and] pure‚Äù as well as beautiful, wise ‚Äúnot through dusky grief, but the ethereal medium of joy ‚Ä¶ and sacred love‚Äù (p. 241). Hawthorne thus captures the catch-22 of feminism: the very woman who is able to envision a new order of living is, by the same token, unable, since the passion that enables her also adulterates her in the eyes of the Puritans. Released from goodness, she is imprisoned in badness, within the framework of a puritanical order. But her mind is free to question the order.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>‚Äî<a href=\"https://wyrdbyword.xyz/l/carol-gilligan\" target=\"_blank\">Carol Gilligan</a><br />\n‚Äîfound in <a href=\"https://wyrdbyword.xyz/l/carol-gilligan-joining-the-resistance\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Joining the Resistance</em></a> (2011)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wdcalink\"><a href=\"https://commonplace.wyrdbyword.xyz/archive/\">[full archive]</a></p>\n",

This is how it will be when I grow up. I shall go there, do this, discover that, love her, and then her and her and her. I shall live as people in novels live and have lived. Which ones I was not sure, only that passion and danger, ecstasy and despair (but then more ecstasy) would be in attendance. However ... who said that thing about ‚Äòthe littleness of life that art exaggerates‚Äô? There was a moment in my late twenties when I admitted that my adventurousness had long since petered out. I would never do those things adolescence had dreamt about. Instead, I mowed my lawn, I took holidays, I had my life.</p>\n<p>But time ... how time first grounds us and then confounds us. We thought we were being mature when we were only being safe. We imagined we were being responsible but were only being cowardly. What we called realism turned out to be a way of avoiding things rather than facing them.

Or, rather, I go to sleep, put under by jorums of drink and fistfuls of jumbo knock-out pills. Then at three or four in the morning my eyelids snap open like faulty window blinds and I find myself in a state of lucid alertness the equal of which I never seem to achieve in daytime. The darkness at that hour is of a special variety too, more than merely the absence of light but a medium to itself, a kind of motionless black glair in which I am held fast, a felled beast prowled about by the jackals of doubt and worry and mortal dread. Above me there is no ceiling, only a yielding, depthless void into which at any moment I might be pitched headlong. I listen to the muffled labourings of my heart and try in vain not to think of death, of failure, of the loss of all that is dear, the world with its things and creatures. The curtained window stands beside the bed like an indistinct dark giant, monitoring me with fixed, maniacal attention. At times the stillness in which I lie comes to seem a paralysis, and I‚Äôm compelled to get up and prowl in a state of jittery panic through the empty rooms, upstairs and down, not bothering to switch on the lights. The house around me hums faintly, so that I seem to be inside a large machine, a generator, say, on stand-by, or the engine of a steam train shunted into a siding for the night and still trembling with memories of the day‚Äôs fire and speed and noise. I will stop at a landing window and press my forehead to the glass and look out over the sleeping town and think what a Byronic figure I must cut, perched up here, solitary and tragic-seeming, no more to go a-roving. This is the way it is with me, always looking in or looking out, a chilly pane of glass between me and a remote and longed-for world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>‚Äî<a href=\"https://wyrdbyword.xyz/l/john-banville\" target=\"_blank\">John Banville</a><br />\n‚Äîfound in <a href=\"https://wyrdbyword.xyz/l/john-banville-blue-guitar\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Blue Guitar</em></a> (2015)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wdcalink\"><a href=\"https://commonplace.wyrdbyword.xyz/archive/\">[full archive]</a></p>\n",
