For sure, it sounds deathly, as though the form is lost to the world, consigned to libraries and anthologies. (As if those are ever really dead.) There have been times – ours is not one of them, I think I will want to say – when the essay has seemed antique and moribund, fit only for the classroom and to become an object of nostalgia for the improving or diverting literature of the past. Essays, ancient or modern, can seem precious in their self-presentation, like things too well made ever to be handled. Touch them however and they are likely to come alive with the sedimented evidence of years; a constellation of glittering motes surrounds the supposedly solid thing, and the essay reveals itself to have been less compact and smooth than thought, but instead unbounded and mobile, a form with ambitions to be unformed. Which is to say – I can’t prove it yet – that the venerable genre of the essay has something to do with the future, with a sense of constant dispersal and coalescence. And for what it’s worth my attachment to them seems of the same conflicted order: I want essays to have some integrity (formally, not morally, speaking), their strands of thought and style and feeling so tightly woven they present a smooth and gleaming surface. And I want all this to unravel in the same moment, in the same work; I want the raggedness, the patchwork, a labyrinth’s-worth of stray threads. You might say I’m <em>torn</em>.</p>\n<p>—<a href=\"https://wyrdbyword.xyz/l/brian-dillon\" target=\"_blank\">Brian Dillon</a><br />\n—found in <a href=\"https://wyrdbyword.xyz/l/brian-dillon-essayism\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Essayism</em></a> (2017)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wdcalink\"><a href=\"https://commonplace.wyrdbyword.xyz/archive/\">[full archive]</a></p>\n",

Le Guin</a></p> \n<blockquote><p>…With a sense of play acting, she proceeded with the hypnotist’s spiel. He went under almost at once. She couldn’t believe it, and tested him. “You can’t lift your left hand,” she said, “you’re trying, but it’s too heavy, it won’t come.  … Now it’s light again, you can lift it. There … well. In a minute now you’re going to fall asleep. You’ll dream some, but they’ll just be regular ordinary dreams like everybody has, not special ones, not—not effective ones. All except one. You’ll have one effective dream. In it—“ She halted. All of a sudden she was scared; a cold qualm took her. What was she doing? This was no play, no game, nothing for a fool to meddle in. He was in her power: and his power was incalculable. What unimaginable responsibility had she undertaken?</p>\n<p>A person who believes, as she did, that things fit: that there is a whole of which one is a part, and that in being a part one is whole: such a person has no desire whatever, at any time, to play God.

K. Chesterton</a></p> \n<blockquote><p>Some little time ago Dr. David Forsyth delivered to the Section of Psychiatry (Royal Society of Medicine) an address which was certainly a psychological curiosity; of considerable interest to psychologists, pathologists, alienists and all other students of the mental breakdown in the modern world. It was a perfect and compact illustration of the very common combination of a superiority complex with arrested development, and inhibitions on almost all forms of intelligent curiosity. But I mention it here, not because of its narrowness, but of its direct negation of all that is really new in scientific discovery. It is no news to us that a materialist can be bigoted; but we do not always come upon so startling an example of his being antiquated.</p>\n<p>It is not worth while to take any particular notice of all the diseased stuff about sadism and masochism being the sources of religion. We may note in passing, with a rather dreary amusement, that this sort of writer can never sustain a connected train of thought; and that he gets even these dismal technical terms hopelessly entangled; for he declares that Islam stands for sadism and Christendom for masochism, having just argued that the Christian persecution of heretics was typically sadistic. But all this judgment of great human events, good or bad, in terms of some obscure streak of lunacy, is itself an amusement for lunatics.  It is exactly as if a man were to argue: “There is a special sort of madman who thinks he is made of glass; I will call this disease Vitreosity; and I will then show that anybody anywhere, who for any reason had anything to do with glass was a victim of vitreosity. The desert merchants who were said to have invented glass, the medieval craftsmen who so successfully coloured glass, the early astronomers who first fitted telescopes with lenses of glass, all showed Vitreosity in various stages of that disease; it is akin to subconscious libido because Peeping Tom looked through a window, which may have been made of glass; it is the root impulse of alcoholism, because people drink out of glasses; and Prince Albert and Queen Victoria were obviously stricken with raving and uncontrolled Vitreosity; because they built the Crystal Palace.”  The slight defect in this theory (which is quite as scientific as Dr. Forsyth’s) is that in order to theorise, it is sometimes useful to think. It is obvious that all these people had a thousand other reasons for doing all they did, besides being mad on glass; and it is equally obvious that the great religions, true or false, had a thousand reasons for doing all they did, without being mad on masochism or sadism.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—<a href=\"https://wyrdbyword.xyz/l/g-k-chesterton\" target=\"_blank\">G.

A rhino-horn of land that juts into the Sea of Marmara, 1,700 miles east of Paris and 1,400 miles north of Baghdad, Stamboul proper, which was founded at the very edge of Europe and within eyeshot of Asia, comes into her own in the classical age when boat technology developed to allow more people, trade goods, armed troops and novel ideas to travel. She flourished when men and women acted on a prehistoric word-idea that, I would argue, kick-starts civilisation. This Proto-Indo-European term <em>ghosti</em> (from which we get the words guest, host and ghost) referred to a kind of unspoken etiquette, a notion that on seeing strangers on the horizon, rather than choose to fell them with spears or sling-shots, instead we should take the risk of welcoming them across our threshold – on the chance that they might bring new notions, new goods, fresh blood with them. Over time this word-idea evolved into the Greek <em>xenia</em> – ritualised guest–host friendship, an understanding that stitched together the ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern worlds. Thanks to new DNA skeletal evidence we now realise that ancient peoples travelled far greater distances and more systematically than we once thought. If civilisation is about reaching out beyond the horizon to embrace the unknown, about making connections, about working out how to live with ourselves and with others, then for both East and West alike Istanbul is perfectly placed to satisfy that urge. And today the need to understand the narrative of what one Byzantine called ‘the city of the world’s desire’ is ever more urgent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—<a href=\"https://wyrdbyword.xyz/l/bettany-hughes\" target=\"_blank\">Bettany Hughes</a><br />\n—found in <a href=\"https://wyrdbyword.xyz/l/bettany-hughes-istanbul\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Istanbul: A Tale of Three Cities</em></a> (2017)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wdcalink\"><a href=\"https://commonplace.wyrdbyword.xyz/archive/\">[full archive]</a></p>\n",

What if one happens to be possessed of a heart that can’t be trusted—? What if the heart, for its own unfathomable reasons, leads one willfully and in a cloud of unspeakable radiance away from health, domesticity, civic responsibility and strong social connections and all the blandly-held common virtues and instead straight towards a beautiful flare of ruin, self-immolation, disaster? Is Kitsey right? If your deepest self is singing and coaxing you straight toward the bonfire, is it better to turn away? Stop your ears with wax? Ignore all the perverse glory your heart is screaming at you? Set yourself on the course that will lead you dutifully towards the norm, reasonable hours and regular medical check-ups, stable relationships and steady career advancement, the New York Times and brunch on Sunday, all with the promise of being somehow a better person? Or—like Boris—is it better to throw yourself head first and laughing into the holy rage calling your name?</p>\n<p>It’s not about outward appearances but inward significance. A grandeur in the world, but not of the world, a grandeur that the world doesn’t understand.

Shame, Despair, Solitude! These had been her teachers,—stern and wild ones,—and they had made her strong, but taught her much amiss. (pp. 183–4)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the end, then, she must be corrected, and unlike Dora—Freud’s patient who flees from what had become the iron framework of his treatment, leaving her analysis in mid-stream—Hester, in the dark conclusion of Hawthorne’s brooding novel, reassumes the Puritan mantle. She assures the women who come to her for counsel and comfort that there will be a new order of living between women and men, grounded not in sorrow but in mutual happiness. She knows that “the angel and apostle of the coming revelation must be a woman” and had once imagined this prophetess might be herself. But the angel must be “lofty [and] pure” as well as beautiful, wise “not through dusky grief, but the ethereal medium of joy … and sacred love” (p. 241). Hawthorne thus captures the catch-22 of feminism: the very woman who is able to envision a new order of living is, by the same token, unable, since the passion that enables her also adulterates her in the eyes of the Puritans. Released from goodness, she is imprisoned in badness, within the framework of a puritanical order. But her mind is free to question the order.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—<a href=\"https://wyrdbyword.xyz/l/carol-gilligan\" target=\"_blank\">Carol Gilligan</a><br />\n—found in <a href=\"https://wyrdbyword.xyz/l/carol-gilligan-joining-the-resistance\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Joining the Resistance</em></a> (2011)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wdcalink\"><a href=\"https://commonplace.wyrdbyword.xyz/archive/\">[full archive]</a></p>\n",

Oisín knew it was there, but the kids took no notice. To them it would look like a tumble of ancient white stones strewn across a hillside of amber grass. Somewhere in that cemetery, Oisín remembered, were buried Spanish missionaries, Matsun Indians, innumerable cattlemen and cattlewomen, a handful of Mahoneys, one of them an infant, and the man who for thirty years drove the stagecoach between San Juan and Monterey. Now the graves were overgrown and though Oisín knew he should feel wistful, he found he did not much care. It did not move him either way; standing over the dead had never held appeal.

This is how it will be when I grow up. I shall go there, do this, discover that, love her, and then her and her and her. I shall live as people in novels live and have lived. Which ones I was not sure, only that passion and danger, ecstasy and despair (but then more ecstasy) would be in attendance. However ... who said that thing about ‘the littleness of life that art exaggerates’? There was a moment in my late twenties when I admitted that my adventurousness had long since petered out. I would never do those things adolescence had dreamt about. Instead, I mowed my lawn, I took holidays, I had my life.</p>\n<p>But time ... how time first grounds us and then confounds us. We thought we were being mature when we were only being safe. We imagined we were being responsible but were only being cowardly.

Or, rather, I go to sleep, put under by jorums of drink and fistfuls of jumbo knock-out pills. Then at three or four in the morning my eyelids snap open like faulty window blinds and I find myself in a state of lucid alertness the equal of which I never seem to achieve in daytime. The darkness at that hour is of a special variety too, more than merely the absence of light but a medium to itself, a kind of motionless black glair in which I am held fast, a felled beast prowled about by the jackals of doubt and worry and mortal dread. Above me there is no ceiling, only a yielding, depthless void into which at any moment I might be pitched headlong. I listen to the muffled labourings of my heart and try in vain not to think of death, of failure, of the loss of all that is dear, the world with its things and creatures. The curtained window stands beside the bed like an indistinct dark giant, monitoring me with fixed, maniacal attention. At times the stillness in which I lie comes to seem a paralysis, and I’m compelled to get up and prowl in a state of jittery panic through the empty rooms, upstairs and down, not bothering to switch on the lights. The house around me hums faintly, so that I seem to be inside a large machine, a generator, say, on stand-by, or the engine of a steam train shunted into a siding for the night and still trembling with memories of the day’s fire and speed and noise. I will stop at a landing window and press my forehead to the glass and look out over the sleeping town and think what a Byronic figure I must cut, perched up here, solitary and tragic-seeming, no more to go a-roving. This is the way it is with me, always looking in or looking out, a chilly pane of glass between me and a remote and longed-for world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—<a href=\"https://wyrdbyword.xyz/l/john-banville\" target=\"_blank\">John Banville</a><br />\n—found in <a href=\"https://wyrdbyword.xyz/l/john-banville-blue-guitar\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Blue Guitar</em></a> (2015)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wdcalink\"><a href=\"https://commonplace.wyrdbyword.xyz/archive/\">[full archive]</a></p>\n",

And we must insist that the leaders of institutions that represent us—large and small—use technology in ways that reflect what is good for individuals and society, and not just what enriches technocrats.\r\n\r\n—from [The Rise of Techno-authoritarianism](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/03/facebook-meta-silicon-valley-politics/677168/) [[archive](https://archive.ph/5fMsR)]\r\n\r\nThis whole piece is an exercise in...I don't even know what. Naïveté? Virtue signaling? Rah-rah for a crowd that already knows...and already knows there's no reality to this call to action?\r\n\r\nThere's virtue to making individual choices, but the system won't be changed by it, and the global nature of the problems means that these technologies will be developed somewhere in just this way, regardless of the harm and despite any nation's policies and laws. \r\n\r\nI sympathize with the call, just as I sympathize with calls to digital silencing, retreats from technology, back to the land...you name any number of dreamy, idealistic notions despite being barely possible for individuals or small groups, much less on larger scales. The entropic reality that is the combination of the human affliction of consciousness, and living at scales and densities that are deeply harmful to our evolutionary present, will not be denied.\n",
